# freenasdocs
Collection of FreeNAS documentation.

This repository is a growing collection of FreeNAS documentation written with
the intent of helping the FreeNAS community. These documents will be written in conjunction with me actually performing the actions on my FreeNAS instance to try and ensure accuracy. 

While a best effort will be made to keep the documentation up to date, my ability to do this is gated by my own time availability and my availability to experiment on my NAS instance. My apologies if things lapse too far.

## Current Version

The current documentation targets:
* FreeNAS Version: **FreeNAS-11.2-RELEASE-U1 (Build Date: Dec 20, 2018 22:41)**
* Jail System: `iocage`

## Table of Contents

* [SSH and Tunnels as "VPN Lite"](/guides/ssh-tunnels.md)
* [OpenVPN Client Jail w/ Downloader and Proxy](/guides/vpn-client-jail.md)

## About
This seems like a better idea and format than reposting partial information on Reddit and the FreeNAS forums whenever common problems arise.
